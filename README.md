# nuxt-periodic-fetching-in-plugin-example

Requirements:

- fetch once on the server
- make response available for client
- periodically fetch the same endpoint afterwards.

If this is run locally, you should see a different value on screen passed 5 seconds, because the initial value was set on server-side and then, reactively, it's updated on the client side.
